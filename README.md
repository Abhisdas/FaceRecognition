# FACE_RECOGNITION PROJECT USING PYTHON.


Face recognition is the process of identifying or verifying the identity of an individual by analyzing and comparing their facial features with a database of known faces. In a face recognition project using Python, we use computer vision algorithms to detect faces in an image or video and then use machine learning techniques to compare and match the detected face with known faces in a database. We can build a face recognition system that can be used for a wide range of applications, including security systems, attendance tracking, and social media tagging. Python provides various libraries and tools, such as OpenCV and face_recognition, to develop a face recognition project efficiently. With these libraries, we can perform tasks such as face detection, face recognition, and face alignment, which are essential for building a robust face recognition system.
